# Extinction-Debt

# This is a folder exploring the implications of "multi-stressor" impacts on food webs or ecosystems. It started from thinking of the Tonle Sap as unifromly impacted set of mortalities. Carling suggested that such a fishery might generate a "balanced fishery". Thistriggered the idea that high,relatively, even mortalities on species may effectively remove the overwhleming signature of interactions and make communities behave more possibly like "neutral dynamic" entities and if species are at low densities they may, in effect, harbour massive extinction debts or alternatively maintainneutraldiversity poisedto takeover if an opportunity arises (the positive side of the issue,the negative side, is they eventually crashdue to noise). Collaboration with Gabriel Gellner and Alan Hastings aswell as Kevin Cazelles.
